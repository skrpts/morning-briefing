## Overview

This workflow produces a personalised morning briefing from your Gmail inbox and Google Calendar. It fetches today's emails and events in parallel, triages emails by urgency, synthesises everything into a readable briefing, and applies a final language polish.

Run it each morning to know exactly what needs your attention, what meetings are ahead, and which emails need replies — all in your voice.

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Parallel Data Fetch

Two data retrieval agents run concurrently:

#### 1a. Email Fetch

Using the Gmail MCP service, search for recent emails (configurable lookback, default 12 hours) and read their content. Flags emails that likely need replies.

#### 1b. Calendar Fetch

Using the Google Calendar MCP service, fetch today's full schedule with event details, attendees, and descriptions.

### Stage 2: Urgency Triage

Classifies each email into four urgency levels: action required, needs reply, FYI, or skippable. Configurable via the `urgency_sensitivity` persona dial.

### Stage 3: Briefing Synthesis

Combines the triaged emails and calendar events into a single briefing. Connects related items (e.g. emails about a meeting happening today). Detail level controlled by the `briefing_detail` persona dial.

### Stage 4: Language Polish

Final cleanup: spelling, grammar, clarity, and Voice Profile alignment. Uses British English throughout.

**Output:** Your morning briefing, ready to read.

## Inputs

| Name | Required | Description | Example |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{input.lookback_hours}}` | No | Hours of email history. Default: 12. | `24` |
| `{{input.focus_labels}}` | No | Gmail labels to prioritise. | `INBOX, IMPORTANT` |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Morning briefing | Day-ahead summary with schedule, action items, replies needed, and FYI digest |

## Setup

Before running this workflow:

1. **Gmail MCP server** — install and configure the Gmail MCP server. Requires OAuth 2.0 credentials with `gmail.readonly` scope.
2. **Google Calendar MCP server** — install and configure the Calendar MCP server. Requires OAuth 2.0 credentials with `calendar.readonly` scope.
3. **Authorise both servers** — on first run, each server will open a browser window for OAuth authorisation.

## Provider Notes

- Email triage is an analytical task — most models handle it well.
- Briefing synthesis benefits from a model with strong writing capabilities.
- The pipeline is moderate on token usage, but high email volumes (50+ emails) will increase consumption.
